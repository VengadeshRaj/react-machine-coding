# Find Pair Card - Card Matching Memory Game

The number of cards is displayed based on the playerâ€™s selected size. When the player clicks on a card, it reveals a number. A matching pair of that number exists among the remaining cards. If the player selects another card with the same number, both cards remain revealed. However, if the player selects a card with a different number, both cards are flipped back and remain hidden.
